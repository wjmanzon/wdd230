<!-- Bountiful Foods is small business specializing in organic, 
    locally grown foods. They are physically located in Carlsbad, 
    California, however, they have many food trucks that cover the 
    coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. The company sells 
    fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area, but 
    also uses some national and international suppliers. The 
    owner-operated company caters to walk in traffic at their 
    storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, their food trucks. 
    They deliver and manage those orders on the phone and via the 
    website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy food 
    options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and 
    fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists visiting 
    the coastal areas. The theme should support healthy eating, 
    organic bounty, and convenience-->
