      <div class="containerrr">
          <div class="col1 top-element">
            <p class="history">Bountiful Foods started as a small family business in 1995 when the owner, 
              Sarah, moved to Carlsbad, California. With a passion for healthy eating and 
              a love for organic, locally grown foods, she began selling fresh produce from 
              the farmers in the area. Her commitment to quality and freshness soon earned 
              her a loyal following of customers who appreciated the delicious taste and 
              health benefits of her products.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <img class="history-image" src="images/history1.png" alt="Placeholder Image">
          </div>
          <div class="col row2">
            <p class="history">Over time, Sarah expanded her business by adding a storefront in Carlsbad 
              where customers could come in and shop for produce directly. She also began 
              selling her products at local farmers' markets and events, where she gained 
              even more exposure and built up a strong reputation for quality and service.</p>

          <div class="col1">

          </div>
          <div class="col1">
            <p class="history">As the business grew, Sarah recognized the need to expand her reach beyond 
              Carlsbad. She invested in a fleet of food trucks that could travel up and 
              down the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego, bringing her organic, 
              locally grown produce to even more customers. The food trucks quickly became 
              a hit, and Bountiful Foods became known as the go-to source for fresh, 
              healthy food on the go.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col row4">
            <p class="history">In recent years, Bountiful Foods has continued to grow, thanks in large part to 
              its commitment to using both local and national suppliers to ensure a wide variety 
              of fresh, high-quality products. The company has also expanded its offerings to 
              include made-to-order fruit drinks and fruit bags, which have proven to be a big 
              hit with customers looking for convenient, healthy options.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col1">
            <p class="history">Today, Bountiful Foods remains a family-owned and operated business, with Sarah 
              still at the helm. Her passion for healthy eating and commitment to quality and 
              service have helped her build a successful business that continues to serve the 
              local community and attract visitors from all over. Whether you're looking for 
              a quick, healthy snack on the go or a wide selection of fresh produce to take home, 
              Bountiful Foods has something for everyone.</p>
